# DDOS-attaque
This activity concerne checking attack network and sniffing with wireshark all the traffic IP address involved with this issue.

"You work as a security analyst for a travel agency that advertises sales and promotions on the company's website. Employees of the company regularly access the company's sales webpage to search for vacation deals that might appeal to their customers."

"One afternoon, you receive an automatic alert from your monitoring system indicating a problem with the web server. You attempt to visit the company's website, but you receive a connection timeout error message in your browser."

"You use a packet sniffer to capture data packets in transit to and from the web server. You notice a large number of TCP SYN requests coming from an unknown IP address. The web server appears to be overwhelmed by the volume of incoming traffic and is no longer able to respond to the abnormally high number of SYN requests. You suspect that the server is under attack by a malicious actor."

"You temporarily take the server offline so that the machine can recover and return to normal operation. You also configure the company firewall to block the IP address that was sending the abnormal number of SYN requests. You know that your IP blocking solution won't last long because an attacker can spoof other IP addresses to bypass this blocking. You need to quickly alert your manager to this issue and discuss next steps to stop this attacker and prevent this problem from happening again. You'll need to be prepared to explain to your manager what type of attack you've discovered and how it's affecting the web server and employees."s
